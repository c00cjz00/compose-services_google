A total of 2,000 women who are 18 - 55 years of age and a smaller comparison group of 1,000 similarly aged men will be enrolled in this multi-site observational study from approximately 120 different hospitals across the country. Young women have a much greater risk of dying after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than similarly aged men. Their mortality risk is markedly higher than that of young men, and limited data on young minority women suggest that they may have the highest risk of any young subgroup. Findings from the small number of published studies of young women with ischemic heart disease suggest that the biology, epidemiology, care, and outcomes of this group are distinct from those of men. To date, there have been no large studies of this population, even as the death toll is comparable to that from breast cancer in this country. This study will help researchers identify key factors that influence recovery from a heart attack and potentially improve the care and outcomes of young women and men with AMI. Specific Aims: To investigate the excess risk in young women with AMI and to identify key demographic, clinical, metabolic, psychosocial, health care delivery, and biological determinants of prognosis, we propose a national, prospective, observational study of 2,000 women who are 55 years or younger with AMI and a smaller comparison group of 1,000 men. Our prior work and preliminary studies indicate that the sex differences are most prominent in this age group and suggest that by 1 year after discharge, there are substantial sex differences in outcomes. We will also develop risk stratification tools that will help clinicians to identify young women with the highest and lowest risk.  Specific Aim 1: Determine sex differences in outcomes following AMI. Specific Aim 2: Determine sex differences in the prevalence and prognostic importance of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors.  Specific Aim 3:Determine sex differences in quality of care.  Specific Aim 4: Determine sex differences in the prevalence and prognostic importance of selected biochemical biomarkers following AMI.  These samples have been whole genome sequenced as part of the NHGRI's Center for Common Disease Genetics at the Broad Institute.\n\n Study Weblinks:\n\nVIRGO\n\n\n Study Design:\n\nProspective Longitudinal Cohort\n\n\n Study Type:\n\nObservational\nCohort\n\n\n\n\tdbGaP estimated ancestry using\n\tGRAF-pop\n\nNumber of study subjects that have individual-level data available through Authorized Access:\n\nNOTE: This text was scraped from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ on 2021-03-09 and may not include exact formatting or images.","full_name":"CCDG CVD: VIRGO - Variation in Recover-Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Patients","short_name":"VIRGO","commons":"AnVIL","study_url":null,"_subjects_count":2158,"__manifest":0,"commons_url":"gen3.theanvil.io","commons_name":"AnVIL"}}
